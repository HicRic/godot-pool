Super Slime Pool

BASIC 

You're a slime on a pool table. You're the cue ball (cue slime)
Other balls are a bunch of various slimes.
typing "slime" is hard

knock slimes into pockets, clear them all to win.
if cue slime falls into pocket, respawn and lose a life
click & drag on cue slime for "pull back & go" slingshot style shoot

maybe the pockets are just other bigger slimes and you're sort of feeding them? or gathering them?

EXTRA

traps, obstacles, interesting table layouts
puzzle slimes:
	slime that only gets pushed by other slimes, not cue slime
	slime that splits in two each time it hits a wall
	slime that you have to hit from one particular side to move it (some kind of directional shield)
	slime that jumps up and down, so you have to time your hit or you pass under it
	slimes that are light/heavy
	
powerups:
	cue slime is heavier for one shot
	cue slime can't fall in pocket / die for one shot
	shot guide (peggle unicorn)
